# Adjusting the Character Limit for Messages on a Greeting Card

## Understanding the Character Limit

When adding messages to a Reco Greeting Card, you may notice a suggested character limit of 350 characters. This is a **soft limit** intended to keep messages concise and maintain readability. However, **we do not impose a hard limit on message length**.

Contributors who wish to write longer messages can do so, even if the suggested limit is exceeded. This ensures flexibility for heartfelt messages, particularly for special occasions like retirements, celebrations, or farewells.

## Why the Soft Limit?

The 350-character guideline is there to:

- Encourage concise, impactful messages.
- Ensure optimal formatting and readability of the card.

However, contributors are free to express themselves without restrictions, and longer messages will still be accommodated on the card.

## What's the Alternative?

For contributors who want to share more extended messages, we recommend splitting their thoughts across multiple entries on the card. This approach allows:

- Better organization and readability.
- The opportunity to add unique formatting or designs to each entry.

This method ensures that all sentiments are captured without overwhelming a single section of the card.
