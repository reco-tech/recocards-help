# AI making mistakes? Here is how to fix it

RecoCards AI is based on a trained LLM model, capable of generating amazing personalized cover images. However, at times, it may make mistakes. Here is how to fix them:

## 1. Tune your prompt
The quality of the output from RecoCards AI heavily depends on the clarity and specificity of the prompt you provide. If the generated cover image doesn’t meet your expectations, consider revising your prompt. Here are some tips for tuning your prompt effectively:

- **Be Specific**: Clearly state what you want in the image, including colors, themes, and any specific elements you want to see. For example, instead of saying "Create a fun cover," you might say "Create a fun cover with vibrant colors and a playful font."

- **Include Key Details**: Mention any particular text you want on the cover, and specify its placement. The more detailed your prompt, the less room there is for errors.

- **Use Examples**: If possible, refer to similar designs or styles that match your vision. This helps the AI understand the aesthetic you’re aiming for.

## 2. Review and Edit the Output

Once RecoCards AI generates the cover image, it’s crucial to review the result carefully. Look for any mistakes in the text, such as typos or incorrect wording, and ensure that the design elements are aligned with your vision. If you spot any issues, don’t hesitate to make adjustments:

- **Text Editing**: Correct any spelling mistakes or adjust the wording directly in the design tool if the AI-generated text isn't accurate.

- **Design Adjustments**: Tweak elements like font size, color, or image placement to better suit your needs.

## 4. Experiment with Variations

If the first generated cover doesn’t hit the mark, don’t hesitate to generate additional variations. RecoCards AI can produce multiple versions of your design, each with slight differences. By experimenting with these variations, you may discover a version that better fits your needs without requiring extensive edits.

## 6. Save and Reuse Successful Prompts

Once you’ve crafted a prompt that produces the desired results, save it for future use. This not only saves time but also ensures consistency across different projects. Over time, you’ll build a library of successful prompts that you can tweak as needed for new cover images.

By following these steps, you can effectively minimize mistakes and ensure that your cover images generated by RecoCards AI are of the highest quality.
