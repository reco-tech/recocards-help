# Refund Policy

At Recocards.com, we strive to ensure that our customers are satisfied with their purchases. If you are not completely satisfied with your purchase, our refund policy is designed to address your concerns promptly and efficiently.

### 1. Eligibility for Refunds
Except as required by law, RecoCards.com is not obligated to issue refunds under any circumstances. If RecoCards determines that you are eligible for a refund of all or part of the fees you paid, the refund will be processed using the original payment method you used to make your purchase. All refunds are at the sole discretion of RecoCards (reserved for exceptional circumstances), and by default, all fees are non-refundable, even if an individual premium card or board is not used or if a subscription is terminated before its expiration.

### 2. Refund Process
**Contact Us**: To initiate a refund, please contact our customer service team at support@recocards.com with your order number, a detailed description of the issue, and any supporting evidence (e.g., photos of damaged products).

**Assessment**: Our team will review your request and may ask for additional information or evidence to process your refund.

**Approval**: If your refund request is approved, we will process the refund to your original payment method within 7-10 business days. You will receive a confirmation email once the refund has been processed.

### 3. Cancellations
**Digital Products**: Orders for digital products cannot be canceled once the product has been downloaded or accessed.

**Physical Products**: Orders for physical products can be canceled within 24 hours of purchase for a full refund. After 24 hours, cancellations may not be possible if the order has already been processed or shipped.

### 4. Shipping Costs
Refunds for physical products will include the original shipping cost. However, return shipping costs are the responsibility of the customer unless the product is defective or not as described.

### 5. Contact Information
